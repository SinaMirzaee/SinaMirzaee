- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SinaMirzaee
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computational neuroscience and network neuroscience; I'm fascinated with high-order cognitive functions such as creativity, concept acquisition, decision-making, etc., and how sensory information and memory can influence them. I'm also keen to face the mathematical challenges introduced while modeling and studying neural networks. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about predictive processing associated with memory and the sensory nervous system and its influence on the motor nervous system. For example, a batter can hit a baseball by predicting its trajectory; in this case, predictive signals from the visual cortex can influence the batter's movement. How are these signals produced and how can they affect their target neural network?
